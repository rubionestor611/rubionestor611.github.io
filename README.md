# Nestor Rubio Portfolio
This is my portfolio page in which you can view all sorts of things about me ranging from work experience to projects and even some facts about me like whether or not I'm currently on Spotify and what I'm listening to.

## Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite
I was seeking the chance to work with Vite and found this to be the perfect way to get exposure to it while practicing my design skills in Figma and flexing my React/TypeScript muscles.

## Backend: Golang API Container on Azure Web App
The data is retrieved via an Azure Web app that is running my Docker container which is hosted in Docker hub and my Azure Cloud Registry. I use this to retrieve Spotify data to display and it was so exciting learning more about Golang and interacting with Spotify's API while creating this.
